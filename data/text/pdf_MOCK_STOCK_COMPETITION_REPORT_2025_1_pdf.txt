The Mock Stock Competition, organized by the Department of Management, MAIT, in association with the 
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), was designed to give students practical exposure to stock market trading. 
The competition was based on the historical ‘ring trading’ method, a system used in the Bombay Stock 
Exchange during the 90’s.This simulation aimed to develop participant’s financial acumen, strategic thinking, 
and negotiation skills. 
 
The event began with an introduction to Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology (MAIT), highlighting its 
commitment to providing real-world financial learning experiences for students. Our esteemed guest, Prof. 
Sanjeev Das, was welcomed with a sapling, presented by Sangeeta Ma’am, HOD of the Management 
Department. 

 
 
 
 
The *Mock Stock Competition* was a ‘ring trading’ simulation that mimicked traditional open-outcry trading 
at the Bombay Stock Exchange. The competition featured 10 leading companies: 
Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, ONGC, SBI, Infosys, Cipla, Tata Steel, Ambuja Cement, ITC, Dabur. 
Each company had one broker responsible for trading and one operator who recorded stock buy-sell entries. 
A total of 35 teams participated as traders, actively negotiating stock prices and conducting transactions. Every 
team was required to complete a minimum of seven transactions within the one-hour trading session. 
 

Trading Process and Results 
 
After the rules were outlined, Prof. Sanjeev Das gave a detailed explanation of how the competition would 
work, providing a brief on how the trading would unfold. 
The atmosphere quickly became filled with hustle and chaos, similar to the actual ring trading process. 
Participants engaged in live trading by negotiating and persuading their fellow traders to buy and sell stocks 
at optimal prices. The fast-paced environment encouraged quick decision-making and strategic investment 
choices. Once transactions were completed for a company, the board managers updated the LTP (Last Traded 
Price), noting the price change in green for an increase and in red for a decrease. The percentage change was 
also calculated accordingly. 
To add tension and excitement to the environment, rumors and news regarding both profitable and negative 
stock movements were shared on the board. Teams had to carefully analyze whether the news was beneficial 
or detrimental to their strategies and decide accordingly. With only seven minutes left in the trading period, 
the final details were updated, and the real-life closing prices were recorded. 
After the one-hour session, trading logs (Sauda Sheets) were collected from all the teams. The final portfolio 
values were calculated, considering stock prices and total holdings. The team with the highest portfolio value 
secured the first position, followed by the second and third highest.
