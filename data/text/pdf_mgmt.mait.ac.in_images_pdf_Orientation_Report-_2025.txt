the significance of teamwork, effective communication, and strong interpersonal 
bonding as the cornerstones of a successful MBA journey. They encouraged students to

Engaging Minds: Interactive Moments from the Orientation 
1. Ice-Breaker: "Name Adjective" 
To start the interaction, the first activity was an ice-breaking game called “Name 
Adjective.” Each student had to introduce themselves by saying their first name along 
with an adjective that best described their personality. For example, “Confident 
Kritika” or “Joyful Rohan.” This light-hearted session not only helped students 
remember each other’s names but also gave them a chance to describe their 
personalities creatively. Laughter and curiosity filled the hall as students came up 
with unique adjectives, which created an atmosphere of openness and camaraderie. 
  
 
  

2. Dumb Charades – A Fun Challenge 
The energy level went a notch higher with the second activity – Dumb Charades. 
Students were divided into small groups and were asked to act out movie names while 
their teammates guessed them. The activity was full of hilarious moments as students 
tried to act in the most creative ways possible. The room echoed with cheers, claps, 
and bursts of laughter, making the environment lively and enjoyable. This game truly 
helped the participants relax and feel like a part of the larger MBA family. 
 
3. Faculty Interaction and Insightful Session 
After the ice-breaking and fun activities, the program transitioned into an interactive 
session with the faculty members. Our respected professors – Dr. Rajiv Jain , Dr. 
Sukhwinder Singh, Dr. Nishant gaur. Mr. Rajat Malik and Dr. Kiran Garg – 
addressed the gathering. They warmly welcomed the freshers and shared valuable 
insights about the institute’s vision, opportunities, and resources.  
A detailed PPT presentation was also shown, which familiarized students with the 
campus facilities, academic guidelines, and extracurricular opportunities available at 
MAIT. The faculty emphasized the importance of discipline, teamwork, leadership, 
and consistent effort in achieving success during the MBA program. Students found 
the session informative and motivating, as it gave them clarity about what to expect in 
the coming two years. 
   
 
  
 
 
 

4. Team Building Exercise 
To strengthen bonding among the new students, a team-building exercise was 
conducted. Students were divided into groups of four to five, and each group was 
given a questionnaire filled with thought-provoking and interesting questions. The 
teams were required to collaborate, discuss their answers, and finally appoint a leader 
who would represent and present the team’s response. 
This activity not only enhanced interaction among the freshers but also showcased 
their leadership skills, decision-making abilities, and group coordination. Many 
teams came up with creative answers and displayed enthusiasm, making the session 
both productive and entertaining. 
  
 
 
5. Pictorial Guessing Game 
The final activity of the day was the Pictorial Guessing Game, in which participants 
were shown images related to songs, riddles, movies, and brand logos. The teams had 
to guess the correct answer as quickly as possible. This game tested the students’ 
observation skills, memory, and quick-thinking abilities while keeping the mood light 
and entertaining. The competitive spirit among the teams kept everyone engaged till 
the very end. 
 
The event concluded around 1:00 PM with a sense of satisfaction and excitement among both 
students and faculty. The orientation program not only served as an introduction to the MBA 
journey at MAIT but also successfully created a welcoming and collaborative atmosphere. 
The combination of fun games, interactive sessions, and insightful guidance from faculty 
ensured that the freshers felt connected to the institute from day one. It was a day filled with 
laughter, learning, and team spirit, and it set the right tone for the upcoming academic year. 
The MBA Orientation 2024 was truly a memorable event that balanced fun with learning 
and marked the beginning of a new chapter in the lives of the students.
