The International Day of Happiness, celebrated on March 20th, serves as a global reminder of the 
importance of well-being and emotional positivity in our lives. To mark this special occasion, the 
Department of Management, Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology (MAIT) organized a 
workshop under the guidance of Dr. Sangeeta Rawal, HOD MBA, Department of Management. The 
workshop aimed to enhance awareness about the significance of mental well-being, emotional 
intelligence, and the science of happiness in personal and professional life. The session began with a 
motivational address by Dr. Sangeeta Rawal, where she emphasized how happiness is a mind-set that 
can be cultivated through intentional practices. 
Key Topics Discussed: 
The Science of Happiness – Understanding the psychological and physiological impact of 
happiness.

external achievements. By practicing gratitude, mindfulness, and self-acceptance, one can lead a truly 
fulfilling life.
