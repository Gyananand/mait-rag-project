alignment with the NEP's goals. 
 

The MMTTP conducted from March 18 to March 26, 2025, was a successful initiative in 
orienting educators about the key principles of the National Education Policy (NEP). The 
diverse range of topics covered, coupled with expert-led discussions, provided participants with 
valuable insights and practical knowledge to apply in their academic careers. The program 
emphasized the importance of inclusivity, skill development, leadership, and the integration of 
technology, all of which are crucial to achieving the transformative goals of the NEP. 
At the conclusion of the program, participants were requested to provide feedback on the effectiveness
