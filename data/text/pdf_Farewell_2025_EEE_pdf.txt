Farewell 2025 – A Heartfelt Goodbye from MAIT EEE ✨🎓 
 
The Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) at MAIT successfully celebrated a truly 
memorable farewell for the graduating batch of 2025 on 23 may 2025 — a day filled with fun, frolic, 
nostalgia, and a wave of emotions. 
From vibrant performances and warm speeches to moments of laughter and tears, every detail reflected 
the love and respect our juniors hold for their seniors. The event was not just a goodbye, but a 
celebration of memories, milestones, and meaningful connections. 
💡 “The spark you leave behind will keep shining in our circuits forever.” 
May you walk ahead with confidence, purpose, and the same energy that lit up our department. 
We’ll miss you. We’re proud of you. We believe in you.
