An industrial visit to Liberty Shoes, Karnal, Haryana, was organized on February 13, 2024, for first-year 
MBA students of Section B. The primary objective of the visit was to provide students with industry 
exposure, enhance their understanding of supply chain and operational processes, and bridge the gap 
between classroom learning and real-world industrial practices. 
Liberty Shoes Limited, Karnal, is a renowned Indian footwear company established in 1954 by Dharam 
Pal Gupta, Purshotam Das Gupta, and Rajkumar Bansal. With over 70 years of operation, the company 
manufactures approximately 60,000 pairs of footwear daily across its four manufacturing units in India. 
Liberty Shoes boasts around 15 footwear brands, including Fortune, Coolers, and Force 10. 
The visit commenced with a briefing by Liberty’s managers, who provided an overview of the company, 
its history, and its evolution over the years. They also introduced students to their product range and the 
various footwear variants produced at the plant. 
Before touring the manufacturing site, students were divided into three groups, each accompanied by a 
development manager to explain the processes in detail. The students observed the entire manufacturing 
cycle, from designing and assembling the shoe upper and lower to the final stages of assembly and 
packaging for commercial distribution. 
Following the site visit, students were served refreshments, including tea and snacks. A question-and-
answer session was then conducted with Mr. Y.K. Sharma, HR Manager, along with the development 
manager. The discussion provided insights into the company's raw material procurement, logistics, 
nationwide operations, and competitive standing. Students actively engaged by posing various queries, all 
of which were addressed comprehensively by the officials. 
The visit concluded with a group photograph of students and faculty. Overall, the industrial visit was 
highly informative and successful, offering students valuable industry exposure and practical insights into 
supply chain and operations management.
