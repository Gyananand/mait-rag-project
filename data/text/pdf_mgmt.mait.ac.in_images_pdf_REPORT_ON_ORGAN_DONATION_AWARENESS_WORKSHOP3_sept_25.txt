The Department of Management (MBA), Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, 
organized an “Organ Donation Awareness Workshop” on September 3, 2025, in collaboration with 
ORGAN India (Organ Receiving & Giving Awareness Network). The session aimed to sensitize 
students of MBA about the importance of organ donation, its ethical aspects, and the role of 
youth in spreading awareness. 
The event was commenced by Dr. Rajiv Jain, setting the tone for an insightful and meaningful 
session. This was followed by a warm welcome address by Dr. Harbhajan Bansal (Dean, 
Management) and Dr. Sangeeta Rawal (Head of the Department, MBA), along with Dr. Neeru Gupta and Dr. 
Anju Bharti felicitated the guest speaker Dr. Sourabh Sharma, Manager – Projects & Outreach, ORGAN 
India, with a memento and sapling as a token of respect. 
The keynote address by Dr. Sourabh Sharma was both engaging and insightful. He highlighted the 
critical need for organ donation in India, addressed common myths, and shared impactful real-
life stories. He encouraged students to view organ donation as a moral responsibility and a way 
to give new life to others. His talk not only informed but also deeply inspired the audience 
to become advocates of this life-saving mission. 
Dr. Sangeeta Rawal also shared her personal perspective on this noble cause, emphasizing the need 
for greater awareness among the youth and the responsibility of educated professionals to lead 
such initiatives in society. Her words added depth and relatability to the session, inspiring 
students to reflect on their own role in spreading awareness. 
The workshop was highly interactive, thought-provoking, and left students with a strong 
message: “ One donor can save multiple lives’. It concluded with a collective commitment 
from participants to spread awareness within their communities. 

 
The event was seamlessly coordinated by Dr. Rajiv Jain, Dr. Neeru Gupta, and Dr. Anju Bharti, whose 
dedicated planning and guidance ensured that the workshop was not only well-organized but 
also left a lasting impact on the participants. In essence, the workshop empowered future managers to
