Workshop on  
Problem solving approach based on  
Psychological Assessment Tool 
 
 
 
On the 12th of March 2024, the esteemed Defense Research and Development Organization 
(DRDO) orchestrated a meticulously planned workshop aimed at students from the Electrical 
and Electronics, as well as Electronics and Communication departments. Titled "Problem-
solving Approach based on Psychological Assessment Tool," the workshop sought to introduce 
innovative methodologies and psychological assessment techniques, with a specific focus on 
enhancing problem-solving skills. 
 
Keynote speakers Dr. Nity Sharma and Dr. Sandhya Verma, both distinguished scientists from 
DRDO, enriched the workshop with their expertise. The event's coordination was seamlessly 
handled by the Heads of Departments (HODs) and faculty coordinators Dr. Anubha Goel and 
Ms. Poonam Juneja ensuring a well-organized and enriching experience for all participants. 
 
 
The workshop spanned an engaging three-hour duration, commencing with an enlightening 
audio-visual presentation. This presentation illustrated a complex problem related to the 
application of inertial sensors in electronic devices, setting the stage for the participants' 
analytical journey. 
 
Following the presentation, a 10-minute individual reflection period was allocated. During this 
time, participants were tasked with analyzing the presented problem, identifying its root causes, 
and proposing plausible solutions. Each student then had the opportunity to articulate their 
unique analyses, contributing to a diverse exploration of potential solutions. 
 
A 20-minute group discussion followed the individual reflection period. This collaborative 
segment allowed participants to explore diverse perspectives and collectively agree upon the 
most effective solutions. The dynamics of these group discussions not only encouraged 
teamwork but also deepened the understanding of how varied viewpoints contribute to 
comprehensive problem-solving strategies. 
 
The pinnacle of the workshop was reached with a personalized interview session for each 
student. Here, faculty members rigorously assessed participants based on a range of criteria, 
aiming to ensure a thorough evaluation of individual problem-solving abilities, analytical skills, 
and effective communication. The personalized nature of the interviews added an extra layer 
of depth to the evaluation process. 
 
 

As the workshop gracefully concluded, certificates were thoughtfully distributed to both the 
diligent attendees and the dedicated faculty members. This symbolic gesture marked the 
successful culmination of an enriching and skill-enhancing experience. 
 
In summary, the workshop not only provided a structured and immersive platform for students 
but also equipped them with invaluable skills and diverse perspectives. Empowered with these 
newfound abilities, participants are well-prepared to confidently tackle real-world challenges 
in their academic and professional journeys. The workshop stands as a testament to the 
commitment of DRDO in fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovative problem-
solving within the academic community. 
 
Furthermore, the success of this workshop extends beyond its immediate impact on 
participants. By integrating psychological assessment tools into problem-solving 
methodologies, DRDO has set a precedent for fostering interdisciplinary approaches within 
engineering education. This initiative not only enhances the technical prowess of students but 
also underscores the importance of holistic development in preparing future innovators and 
leaders. As participants carry forward the lessons learned from this workshop into their 
academic pursuits and eventual careers, they will undoubtedly contribute to the advancement 
of not only their respective fields but also to the broader landscape of scientific and 
technological innovation.
