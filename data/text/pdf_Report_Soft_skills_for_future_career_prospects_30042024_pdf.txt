Soft skills are character traits and interpersonal skills that characterise a person's ability 
to interact effectively with others. In the workplace, soft skills are considered to be a 
complement to hard skills, which refer to a person's knowledge and occupational skills. 
 
Department of Management at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology was elated by 
organising a guest lecture on “Soft skills for Future Career Prospects” for all the MBA 
1st year students.   
The session was conducted by Prof. Jagdish Mehta, who was the former director of 
Doordarshan and is currently working as a visiting professor at GDG University 
Gurugram and Professor of Practice at CPU Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh. 
 
The lecture commenced with an exploration of what soft skills entail. It was elucidated 
that soft skills encompass a broad range of non-technical abilities, including 
communication, 
leadership, 
teamwork, 
adaptability, 
problem-solving, 
time 
management, and emotional intelligence. These skills are essential for effective 
interaction and collaboration in professional settings. 
The speaker underscored the increasing emphasis placed by employers on soft skills 
during the hiring process. In today's dynamic and interconnected world, organizations 
prioritize candidates who not only possess technical competencies but also demonstrate 
strong interpersonal skills. Soft skills are pivotal for fostering a positive work 
environment, enhancing productivity, and driving innovation. 
The guest lecturer highlighted the correlation between proficiency in soft skills and 
career progression. Individuals proficient in communication, for instance, are better 

equipped to convey ideas persuasively, negotiate effectively, and build meaningful 
relationships with colleagues and clients. Moreover, soft skills empower professionals 
to navigate challenges, seize opportunities, and adapt to changing circumstances, 
thereby enhancing their employability and promotability. 
Practical strategies for honing soft skills were shared during the lecture. These included 
actively seeking feedback, engaging in continuous learning and self-improvement, 
participating in extracurricular activities, volunteering, networking, and seeking 
mentorship. The speaker emphasized the importance of stepping out of one's comfort 
zone and embracing opportunities for growth and development. 
In conclusion, the guest lecture underscored that while technical expertise may open 
doors, it is soft skills that ultimately determine one's success in the professional arena. 
Attendees were encouraged to prioritize the cultivation of soft skills alongside their 
academic pursuits, recognizing them as indispensable assets for future career prospects. 
The session concluded with a call to action for individuals to embark on their journey 
of self-improvement and skill enhancement. 
Feedback from attendees was overwhelmingly positive, with many expressing gratitude 
for the insights gained during the lecture. Several participants noted their intention to 
actively work on strengthening their soft skills and integrating them into their career 
development plans. The guest lecture served as a catalyst for introspection and action, 
inspiring individuals to invest in their personal and professional growth.  
Overall, the guest lecture on "Soft Skills for Future Career Prospects:” proved to be 
informative, engaging, and impactful, resonating with individuals across diverse 
backgrounds and career stages.
