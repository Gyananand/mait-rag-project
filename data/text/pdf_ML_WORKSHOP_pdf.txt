ML Workshop 
“Explore the future with our Machine Learning seminar, Knowledge is power and 
innovation awaits” was a thoughtprovoking and entertaining event that the IEEE 
MAIT hosted on October 10, 2023 in collaboration with Dr Vinay Saini sir (HOD 
AI&DS MAIT), to celebrate the joyous occasion of IEEE day. The event's goal was 
to mentor the next generation in the use of emerging technologies and inform 
them on developments in the domains of machine learning and artificial 
intelligence. We are delighted to report that the event was a huge success.
