Electrical & Electronics Engineering 
Workshop on MATLAB and SIMULINK   
The workshop on MATLAB and SIMULINK was organized by the Electrical & Electronics 
Engineering department, MAIT from the 7-9th May 2024. The event aimed to provide faculty 
and staff members with a comprehensive understanding and practical knowledge of MATLAB 
and SIMULINK, an essential tool for engineering education and research. The keynote speakers 
- Mr. Varun Srivastav, Dr. Monika Gupta and Prof Rajveer Mittal shared their valuable insights 
about the software and its application in engineering. Ms. Supriya Sharma, as the faculty 
coordinator, ensured the seamless execution of the workshop. 
 
The primary objective of the workshop was to equip the faculty and staff with the skills needed 
to integrate MATLAB and SIMULINK into their teaching and research activities. The program 
sought to enhance the participants' ability to use these tools for solving complex engineering 
problems, thereby improving the quality of education and research outputs. 
 
The event commenced with an inaugural speech by Dr. Monika Gupta, Head of Department 
EEE MAIT. She emphasized on the importance of keeping abreast with modern engineering 
tools and technologies to maintain the institute's academic excellence. The first day featured an 
introduction to MATLAB. Mr. Varun Srivastav, an expert on MATLAB conducted the sessions. 
Topics covered included the basics of MATLAB, its interface, and fundamental programming 
concepts and latest toolbox offered by MATLAB. The Hands-on training sessions post lunch 
allowed participants to familiarize themselves with the environment and execute basic 
commands    and scripts. All the participants later, enrolled in the certified courses offered by 
MATLAB. 
 
The second day focused on some advanced features of MATLAB, including data visualization, 
matrix operations, and advanced mathematical functions. Prof. Rajveer Mittal, a senior 
professor in Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology led the session. Members of staff and 
faculty engaged in practical exercises that illustrated the application of these features in solving 
real-world engineering problems. Numerous case studies were discussed and a fruitful 
interactive discussion happened.  
 
The final day was dedicated to SIMULINK by speaker-Dr. Monika Gupta, HOD(EEE). 
Participants were introduced to the SIMULINK environment, model creation, and simulation 
techniques. The hands-on session included building and simulating dynamic systems models, 
highlighting SIMULINK's utility in control systems, signal processing, and other engineering 
domains. Feedbacks were taken by the participants about the workshop and their progress about 
the MATLAB were discussed 
 
The workshop was highly successful in achieving its objectives. Faculty members expressed 
their appreciation for the detailed and practical approach of the sessions. The training provided 
them with the confidence and skills to incorporate MATLAB and SIMULINK into their 
curriculum and research projects. Participants provided positive feedback, noting the clarity of 
instruction and the practical applicability of the knowledge gained. Suggestions for future 
workshops included extending the duration to cover more advanced topics and providing 
additional resources for continued learning.
