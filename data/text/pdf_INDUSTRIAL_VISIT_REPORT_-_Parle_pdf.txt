The Department of Management, MAIT organized an industrial visit to Parle-G Neemrana, for 
the BBA (Batch 2022-25). 
Parle G, a well-known brand in the biscuit industry, operates a manufacturing plant in 
Neemrana. Department of Management, MAIT organized a visit to the Parle G Neemrana plant 
to provide students with insights into the processes of Parle G biscuits.  
The primary objective was to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts in management and 
their practical application, emphasizing the importance of real-world implications. 
Upon arriving at the Parle G Neemrana plant, students were briefed on the visit's rules. The 
visit commenced with the presentation of a memento to Mr. Narender Singh, the Unit Head. 
The guides then welcomed the students, introducing Parle G through a video. The video 
covered the brand's history, the variety of biscuits produced, and the company's contributions 
to the community.  
Following the video, the students were taken to the heart of the production process known as 
"The Factory Floor." Here, students have explained the intricate process of biscuit 
manufacturing. Students witnessed the mixing of ingredients, the baking process, and the 
packaging of Parle G biscuits.  
Throughout the visit, students gained knowledge about quality control measures, the various 
stages involved in biscuit production, and the plant's maintenance protocols for ensuring safety.  
The plant guides actively engaged with students, addressing their queries and providing 
detailed explanations. The interactive session enhanced the educational experience, allowing 
students to grasp the practical aspects of management concepts. 
The visit to the Parle G Neemrana plant proved to be an enriching and educational experience 
for the students. It offered a tangible connection between classroom theory and real-world 
applications. The students expressed enthusiasm and thoroughly enjoyed the trip, gaining 
valuable insights into the biscuit manufacturing industry. 
This educational undertaking, aimed at facilitating student learning, received substantial 
support from Prof. (Dr.) Amit Gupta, an esteemed academician and the Head of the Department 
of Management, at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology.
